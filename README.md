## About

Hi, there - thanks for checking out the repo! This site is a recreation of my [personal portfolio site](https://brennacclark.github.io), but made with Angular instead of React. 

**üìù Assignment**
- Recreate my react portfolio site, brennacclark.github.io, in Angular. 

**üîç Focus on**
- Component Composition
- Component Communication

**üì¶ Deliverables** 
- Shoot for a view or two with some state changing

**‚≠êÔ∏è Goal** 
- Recreate the look of my portfolio site, but improve the quality 
of project structure and code with what I‚Äôve learned. 



## Angular 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
